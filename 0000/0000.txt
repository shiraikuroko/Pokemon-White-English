Hi! I am a humble Maid! My master has a big heart to match his big belly. He's a gourmet! So I am looking for ingredients that will make his heart jump for joy!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff... Oh, that aroma! It smells so gourmet! Do you have a wonderful ingredient in your Bag? Would you consider selling it to me?
Oh, it smells so good! That "item name here" of yours is a very rare ingredient indeed! Would you take "$ amount sold" for it?
Turned over the "item name here" and received "$ amount sold"!
Merci! Thank you!! With this, I can create a superb menu. My master will be so surprised!
Hmmm... This is not quite what I'm looking for. I don't think my master will be satisfied with such a smell...
Aww... Well, that's OK. If you find a gourmet ingredient for me, please let me know!
Sniff, sniff... Sniff, sniff... Well, I don't smell anything interesting in your Bag. But if you find a gourmet ingredient, please let me know!

Ore, ore, ore... Ores that I adore! Ah, this is where you should laugh... Anyway... I will pay you well for rare ores. And not just ores! Stones, gems, shards...anything mineral! I love it all!
Don't you have an adorable ore that shakes my core?
Oh, I do adore the ores! That "item name here", it's shaking me! Will you sell it for "$ amount sold"?
Turned over the "item name here" and received "$ amount sold"!
The deal is done! I've scored an ore I can adore!
Huh? What on earth is this? You can't shake my core with an ore so poor!
Hmmm. My core won't change. I hope you sell it to me someday.
Don't you have an adorable ore that shakes my core? Hmmmm. You don't seem to have it. Come back again.

As you can see, I am an ultrarich billionaire! And as you can see, my hobby is to collect rare items! In fact, this outfit is ultra expensive and rare. Can you see it? Can you?
There's something that this billionaire wants to get his hands on, even if it means spending a lot of money. Do you have such a rare item? Do you?
That "item name here"!! Will you sell it to me "$ amount sold"? Will you?
Turned over the "item name here" and received "$ amount sold"!
I got a very good item! Don't you think it's great? Don't you?
This is slightly different. Don't you think so, too? Don't you?
If you ever change your mind, will you sell me the rare item? Will you?
Actually, it's... It's a rare treasure, Relic Crown! I was told it was at the innermost part of the Abyssal Ruins! I think it is understandable that you want to treasure it, but will you sell it to me for "$ amount sold"? Will you?
There's something that this billionaire wants to get his hands on, even if it means spending a lot of money. Do you have such a rare item? Do you? Grrr! You don't have a rare item, do you?

Nope, this is no good. Not worth my while.
